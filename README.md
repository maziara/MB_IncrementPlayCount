# MB_IncrementPlayCount
A simple  add-on for [MusicBee](https://getmusicbee.com/) to increment the PlayCount of the selected tracks.

I know this might be achievable in different ways, or using other add-ons, like export/edit/import tags using the [additional-tagging-and-reporting-tools](https://getmusicbee.com/addons/plugins/49/additional-tagging-and-reporting-tools/) plugin.
However, I used this simple project to get myself familiar with MusicBee's API.

# Installation
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/maziara/MB_IncrementPlayCount/releases/latest).
Then either copy it into the plugin folder of your MusicBee and restart the program.
Or, in MusicBee go to *Prefrences>Plugins>Add_Plugin*, and point to the downloaded DLL.

# Usage
This plugin creates a new command in *Tools>Increment_PlayCount*. 

Alternatively, you can assign a hotkey to this command by going to *Prefrences>HotKeys*, find *Tools: Increment PlayCount* and assign a hotkey to it.
